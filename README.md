This  a solution for the Programming question asked of Yo2Yoga Interview.
I have implemented the solution using Angular.js  and added some style using less.

Here's how you can view the demo :
First off, we need a Json file containing the structure of objects and data .Download the Json file here :
<a href=http://www.filedropper.com/yo2><img src=http://www.filedropper.com/download_button.png width=127 height=145 border=0/></a><br /><div style=font-size:9px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;width:127px;font-color:#44a854;> <a href=http://www.filedropper.com >file upload</a></div>

Open the website here:

Click on Load file and Navigiate to the download Json File, once the file is opened,on the left side text-area you can see the file and on the right side required solution.
